When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a "pseudo" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a move to compete with Steam, Microsoft plans to increase the money it pays to developers who publish their games on the Microsoft Store.
